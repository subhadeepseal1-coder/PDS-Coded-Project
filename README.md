My Learnings
ðŸ“Š 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Learned to perform univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to uncover patterns, distributions, and relationships within car sales data. Identified key drivers of sales, such as price, car type, customer demographics, fuel type, and location-based factors. ðŸ§® 2. Python for Data Handling & Analysis: Strengthened your skills in using Pandas and NumPy for: Data cleaning and wrangling Aggregation and transformation of datasets Handling missing values and outliers ðŸ“ˆ 3. Data Visualization: Applied Matplotlib to create insightful plots (e.g., histograms, box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps) to detect patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the dataset. Used visuals to effectively communicate findings and support business decisions. ðŸ§  4. Pattern Detection & Customer Profiling: Uncovered anomalous trends, such as irregular sales spikes or dips across models or regions. Segmented customers based on buying behavior and vehicle preferences to create actionable customer profiles. ðŸ’¡ 5. Insight Generation & Business Recommendations: Translated data patterns into strategic recommendations for Austoâ€™s marketing, product development, and regional planning. Proposed data-driven solutions for improving sustainability and competitiveness in the U.S. automobile market. ðŸ’¡ Overall Takeaway: Learned how to use Python and EDA techniques to extract meaningful insights from automotive sales data. This project strengthened my ability to perform deep analytical work, build customer profiles, and offer evidence-based recommendations to support business growth and sustainability.
